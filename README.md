# DLIO: Source Code for Determining the Entropy and Compression Ratio Relationship

# Developers

## Version Control

This repository uses `git lfs` and thus it must be installed in your system
to work on this project.

To install `git lfs` please see this [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage)

The following code within `.gitattributes` sets the git lfs to track .jpg files.

```
*.jpg filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

```

## Directory Structure

### results

Within the results dir, all of the outputs or plots generated by the scripts should be stored in a subdir
that is named by its date of generation by using the following standard in numeric form: `YEAR-MONTH-DATE`.
For example a plot generated on March 14, 2024, the subdir name to house the plot should be `2024-03-14`.

## Preparing Environment

I would recommend using a `conda` virtual environment or use a docker container in order to develop on this project.

Note: The `environment.yml` is used to setup the conda env.

### Using Conda for Local Env

#### How to Install Conda

Please see the conda documentation for the installation of conda env [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

For `macos` users you can install conda using the following commands:

```
brew install --cask anaconda

```

#### Setting Up Conda Env

Run the following command after you have conda installed:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate base

```

### Using Docker

An alternative to setting up the conda environment on your local machine is to create a docker image and running the docker image on a docker container.

#### Installing Docker

To install docker please see the docker offical documentation on installation [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

#### Running Docker

The dockerimage is to be run using the interactive mode so that each python script can be run
using the docker attached terminal instead of having a default script to be run.

To run use the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d

docker-compose exec python_container bash
```

#### Closing Docker

To close the docker interactive shell, simply enter `exit`. Then
you will have to run `docker-compose down` to close the container.
